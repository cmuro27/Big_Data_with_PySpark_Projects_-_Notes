You'll treat the last word as the last_name, and all other words as the first_name. You'll be using some new functions in this exercise including .split(), .size(), and .getItem(). The .getItem(index) takes an integer value to return the appropriately numbered item in the column. The functions .split() and .size() are in the pyspark.sql.functions library.\n",
