        "The final step is to account for some words occurring frequently across many documents. If a word appears in many documents then it's probably going to be less useful for building a classifier. We want to weight the number of counts for a word in a particular document against how frequently that word occurs across all documents. To do this you reduce the effective count for more common words, giving what is known as the \"inverse document frequency\". "
